## Submission

It is important for me to stress that the project I initially worked on was corrupted during a hard-crash of my system. As a consequence of this and the circumbstances surrounding my mother-in-laws death, I have not managed to complete this project as specified.

I know this is just the bare-bones of the blog. The CRUD that I had implemented was local and so much has happened since then that it was simply not feasable to implement, as I more or less had to start over from scratch.

------

I do not know where this leaves me. For the time and issues I had, my main goal was to get the blog up and running through Heroku, and regardless of the incomplete state of the project, I at least achieved this.

In a week I am sure I could get full CRUD and frontend interface up and running for creation and deletion of posts.
